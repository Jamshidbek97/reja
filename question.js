// "What is pacjage.json file in Node.js?"
// A package.json file in Node.js is a file that holds various metadata relevant to the project. This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the project's dependencies. The package.json file is also used to set up scripts that can be run using npm.

// const http = require('http'); meaning in Node.js
// In Node.js, the require() function is used to import modules. In this case, the require('http') statement is used to import the built-in HTTP module, which provides functionality to create an HTTP server and handle HTTP requests and responses.

// server.listen(3000, 'localhost', () => {
//   console.log('Server running at http://localhost:3000/'); meaning in Node.js
// In Node.js, the server.listen() method is used to start the HTTP server. In this case, the server is configured to listen on port 3000 and the hostname 'localhost'. Once the server is started, the callback function is executed, which logs a message to the console indicating that the server is running and accessible at http://localhost:3000/.

// Is python also single-threaded?
// Yes, Python is also single-threaded. Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecodes concurrently. However, Python supports asynchronous programming using libraries like asyncio, which allows for concurrent execution of I/O-bound tasks within a single thread.

// const client = require('server');
// const db = client.db(); meaning in Node.js briefly
// In Node.js, the require() function is used to import modules. In this case, the require('server') statement is used to import a module named 'server'. The db() function is then called on the imported module to retrieve a database connection object, which can be used to interact with a database. This code snippet suggests that the 'server' module provides functionality related to database operations. 
// What is db in this context?
// In this context, db likely refers to a database connection object or client that is used to interact with a database. The db() function is called on the imported 'server' module to retrieve this database connection object, which can then be used to perform operations such as querying, inserting, updating, or deleting data in the database. The specific implementation of the db() function and the database operations it supports would depend on the functionality provided by the 'server' module.

// API structures?  RESTful API, GraphQL, SOAP, JSON-RPC, XML-RPC, gRPC, etc.
// RESTful API: A RESTful API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server communication protocol, typically using HTTP. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations on resources identified by URIs. They are widely used for web services and are known for their simplicity and scalability.                   

// What is cluster in database?
// In the context of databases, a cluster refers to a group of servers or nodes that work together to store and manage data. Clustering is a technique used to improve the availability, performance, and scalability of databases by distributing data and processing across multiple nodes. There are different types of database clustering, such as shared-disk clustering, shared-nothing clustering, and multi-master clustering, each offering different benefits and trade-offs.

// res.json({state: "success"}); meaning in Node.js
// In Node.js, the res.json() method is used to send a JSON response to the client. In this case, the code snippet is sending a JSON object with a key-value pair {state: "success"} as the response. This response indicates that the operation (likely a deletion operation) was successful, and the client can use this information to handle the response accordingly.    

// architectural pattern and design pattern in Node.js
// Architectural patterns in Node.js refer to high-level structures that provide guidelines and best practices for organizing and designing the components of a Node.js application. Some common architectural patterns used in Node.js applications include:
// - Model-View-Controller (MVC): Separates the application into three interconnected components (models, views, and controllers) to improve code organization and maintainability.
// - Microservices: Decomposes the application into smaller, independent services that communicate over a network, enabling scalability and flexibility.
// - Serverless: Focuses on building applications using serverless computing services, where developers write code without managing servers or infrastructure.
// Design patterns in Node.js refer to reusable solutions to common software design problems that arise during application development. Some common design patterns used in Node.js applications include:
// - Singleton: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
// - Factory: Creates objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.    
// - Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
// - Promises: Provides a way to work with asynchronous operations in a more readable and manageable manner.

// What is axios in Node.js?
// Axios is a popular JavaScript library used for making HTTP requests from Node.js or the browser. It provides a simple and intuitive API for sending and handling HTTP requests, supporting features such as request and response interception, automatic transformation of JSON data, and the ability to cancel requests. Axios is commonly used in Node.js applications for interacting with external APIs, fetching data from servers, and handling AJAX requests.
